There is an m x n rectangular island that borders both the Pacific Ocean and Atlantic Ocean. The Pacific Ocean touches the island's left and top edges, and the Atlantic Ocean touches the island's right and bottom edges.

The island is partitioned into a grid of square cells. You are given an m x n integer matrix heights where heights[r][c] represents the height above sea level of the cell at coordinate (r, c).

The island receives a lot of rain, and the rain water can flow to neighboring cells directly north, south, east, and west if the neighboring cell's height is less than or equal to the current cell's height. Water can flow from any cell adjacent to an ocean into the ocean.

Return a 2D list of grid coordinates result where result[i] = [ri, ci] denotes that rain water can flow from cell (ri, ci) to both the Pacific and Atlantic oceans.

 

Example 1:


Input: heights = [[1,2,2,3,5],[3,2,3,4,4],[2,4,5,3,1],[6,7,1,4,5],[5,1,1,2,4]]
Output: [[0,4],[1,3],[1,4],[2,2],[3,0],[3,1],[4,0]]
Explanation: The following cells can flow to the Pacific and Atlantic oceans, as shown below:
[0,4]: [0,4] -> Pacific Ocean 
       [0,4] -> Atlantic Ocean
[1,3]: [1,3] -> [0,3] -> Pacific Ocean 
       [1,3] -> [1,4] -> Atlantic Ocean
[1,4]: [1,4] -> [1,3] -> [0,3] -> Pacific Ocean 
       [1,4] -> Atlantic Ocean
[2,2]: [2,2] -> [1,2] -> [0,2] -> Pacific Ocean 
       [2,2] -> [2,3] -> [2,4] -> Atlantic Ocean
[3,0]: [3,0] -> Pacific Ocean 
       [3,0] -> [4,0] -> Atlantic Ocean
[3,1]: [3,1] -> [3,0] -> Pacific Ocean 
       [3,1] -> [4,1] -> Atlantic Ocean
[4,0]: [4,0] -> Pacific Ocean 
       [4,0] -> Atlantic Ocean
Note that there are other possible paths for these cells to flow to the Pacific and Atlantic oceans.
Example 2:

Input: heights = [[1]]
Output: [[0,0]]
Explanation: The water can flow from the only cell to the Pacific and Atlantic oceans.
 

Constraints:

m == heights.length
n == heights[r].length
1 <= m, n <= 200
0 <= heights[r][c] <= 105



class Solution {
public:
    int m, n;
    vector<vector<int>> directions = {{1,0}, {-1,0}, {0,1}, {0,-1}};

    vector<vector<int>> pacificAtlantic(vector<vector<int>>& heights) {
        m = heights.size();
        n = heights[0].size();

        vector<vector<bool>> pacific(m, vector<bool>(n, false));
        vector<vector<bool>> atlantic(m, vector<bool>(n, false));

        for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) dfs(0, j, heights, pacific);
        for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) dfs(i, 0, heights, pacific);

        for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) dfs(m-1, j, heights, atlantic);
        for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) dfs(i, n-1, heights, atlantic);

        vector<vector<int>> result;
        for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                if (pacific[i][j] && atlantic[i][j]) {
                    result.push_back({i, j});
                }
            }
        }

        return result;
    }

    void dfs(int i, int j, vector<vector<int>>& heights, vector<vector<bool>>& visited) {
        visited[i][j] = true;
        
        for (auto& d : directions) {
            int x = i + d[0], y = j + d[1];
            
            if (x < 0 || x >= m || y < 0 || y >= n) continue;
            if (visited[x][y]) continue;
            if (heights[x][y] < heights[i][j]) continue;
            
            dfs(x, y, heights, visited);
        }
    }
};


Intuition
The problem asks us to find cells in a grid of heights from which water can flow to both the Pacific Ocean (top/left edges) and the Atlantic Ocean (bottom/right edges).

Instead of simulating water flowing from each cell to the oceans (which would be slow ❌), we reverse the process ✅:

Start from the oceans’ borders and simulate water flowing inward (to higher or equal height cells).

Any cell visited by both Pacific and Atlantic flows can reach both oceans.

Approach
Use DFS (or BFS) from all border cells touching the Pacific and Atlantic oceans.

Pacific → top row + left column

Atlantic → bottom row + right column

During DFS/BFS, only move to neighbors with height ≥ current height.

This ensures water could have flowed down into the current cell.
Maintain two visited matrices (or sets): pacific and atlantic.

After traversal, the answer is the intersection of these two sets.

Complexity
Time complexity : O(m * n)
Every cell is visited at most twice (once from each ocean).

Space complexity : O(m * n)
For visited matrices + recursion/stack space.
